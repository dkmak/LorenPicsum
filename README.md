# Quick Android Application Activity


Suppose we need a simple Android app to display a grid of images:
1. Use the "empty activity" template to get started (or your already set up project with dependencies).
2. Use the site https://picsum.photos to fetch a list of images from their API ( https://picsum.photos/v2/list ).
 * Add a dynamic query parameter for "limit" that can be easily adjusted from callers.
3. Provide a UI that will do the following:
 * Display a grid of images.
 * Provide details (author, id) about the picture when clicking on it.
 * Sort images by author.
